# Fantastle Reboot

As the name might imply, this is a reboot of an earlier game by the same author, called Fantastle - a fusion of maze solving and role-playing genres.

The purpose of the reboot is addressing the low quality of fusion the original Fantastle achieved with its final beta release.

The game is now written in Lua, using the [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) engine. The previous Java version can be found in the "legacy/java-eclipse" branch.
