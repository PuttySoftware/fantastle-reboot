# Fantastle Reboot

As the name might imply, this is a reboot of an earlier game by the same author, called Fantastle - a fusion of maze solving and role-playing genres.

The purpose of the reboot is addressing the low quality of fusion the original Fantastle achieved with its final beta release.

Also, this reboot itself is getting rebooted: due to lack of Windows hardware to build Windows binaries with, the engine is changing from a custom Java one to LÃ–VE, which supports building Windows releases with what is available.
