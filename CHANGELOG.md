**Change Log**

v0.5.0-beta (2019-12-08): Added a Twisted Hallways with Rooms world generator. Added customization settings for the new generator. Added an update checking mechanism (automatic checks are off by default and must be enabled in Preferences manually). Binary builds are now possible to create. Added Closed Door and Open Door objects. Removed unused code and resources, and fixed all the remaining known bugs.

v0.4.0-alpha (2019-11-29): Added Stairs Down, Stairs Up, Pit. Spring, Super Pit and Super Spring objects to the game. The party can now have up to 10 members, as opposed to just 1. Renamed Castes to Jobs. All creatures (party members, monsters, and bosses) have a faith, job and race. Simplified party creation: Personalities and genders only added confusion; they're gone now. Party members now come with default names. A party can be automatically created, if you'd like. Battles feature more than just 1 monster now. Monsters on different teams will attack each other, in addition to you. There's new settings for the maze generator, as well as World- and Level-specific settings in the editor. New music! Loading / saving games is now separate from that for worlds. Renamed Mazes to Worlds. Battles are less broken now. The editor doesn't try to draw the player, fail, and crash if it's not set. Checks to see if there's enough action points in battle are now all done the same way. All file versions and file extensions were reset. Files from older versions are not compatible with this version, and vice versa. Cleaned up old text referencing previous games.

0.3.0-alpha (2019-11-29): Monsters are now always hidden in the dungeon. The editor works... sort of. Lots more buggy behavior was made no longer buggy.
